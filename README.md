# Mathematica Advent of Code
# 2021

This repository stores my [Advent Of Code](http://adventofcode.com/2021/) solutions for 2021, written in Mathematica.  Some of these solutions are simple one-liners, and others are procedural and not fundamentally different from most other common programming languages, and so don't have any READMEs associated with them.  Some (marked in **bold**) are more involved and have (or need) explanations.  I'm using .wls instead of .m, and trying to make the code somewhat readable as plaintext, but casual Mathematica in general is notebook-heavy, and isn't great to view on GitHub.

There's also a utilities file, Ulitities.nb, with some functions that proved useful in previous years.  This is not a true utils file, in that it isn't a paclet and that I don't import the function definitions directly, but it's mostly there as boilerplate code I can copy in when need be.

### Day 1: Stalling the Seven Seas

Today, we lost the sleigh keys on the ocean:  
A tragedy we'll need a month to right.  
They're truly lost; we haven't got a notion  
Of where they got to after leaving sight.  
And so from duty verging on devotion  
We'll start our month-long enterprise tonight.  
We certainly won't rummage in slow-motion...  
(...okay, we just like submarines, alright?)  

We'll need a month, at least, to find the keys  
Which, sadly, we misplaced beneath the seas.
