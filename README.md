# Mathematica Advent of Code
# 2021

This repository stores my [Advent Of Code](http://adventofcode.com/2021/) solutions for 2021, written in Mathematica.  Some of these solutions are simple one-liners, and others are procedural and not fundamentally different from most other common programming languages, and so don't have any READMEs associated with them.  Some (marked in **bold**) are more involved and have (or need) explanations.  Also, this year, I'm using .wls instead of .m, and trying to make the code somewhat readable as plaintext.

There's also a utilities file, Ulitities.nb, with some functions that proved useful in previous years.  This is not a true utils file, in that it isn't a paclet and that I don't import the function definitions directly, but it's mostly there as boilerplate code I can copy in when need be.
